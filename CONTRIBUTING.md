* Make a new branch, from the `master` branch in your forked repository.
  * Give your branch a meaninful name.
  * Code away, but stick to the [WordPress Coding Standards](http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards).
* When you make a commit, write a meaninful commit message.
* Push the changes to your fork and submit a pull request to the `master` branch of the plugin's repository.

## Code Documentation

* Code comments should be added to all new functions/methods.
* Comments should tell you the "what" & "why", keep it concise, you don't need to explain how your code works in a comment.
* Refer to the [WordPress PHP Documentation Standards](http://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/inline-documentation-standards/php-documentation-standards/) doc for guidelines and best practises.
* Use `@param` & `@return` PHPdoc tags for every function/method if applicable.

I have a day job, so sometimes I won't have time to look at your pull requests immediately, but I will devote time to this every couple of days, so be patient.
